This is my deepspeech transcriber. I used Python 3.9.13 for this project, to my knowledge DeepSpeech isn't compatible with Python 3.10+ at the time of writing. Please download the latest models (.ppbm and .scorer) from this link:

https://deepspeech.readthedocs.io/en/r0.9/?badge=latest

Once downloaded, please save the models in a folder called models in the same directory as the scripts. If you run app.py and upload a .wav audio file to 127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser, you will recieve your transcription. However, it may take some time if you upload a large file.

For a faster transcriber that includes punctuation in the transcription use this link here:
